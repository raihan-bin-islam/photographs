          <h1>Photography By Rizon</h1>
          <p>
            It's a collection of photographs from my brother's black and white albums. Here, I just represented some of
            his works that I loved the most. The website is mostly focused on different animations ranging from navbar
            animation to slider animation to scroll animation.
